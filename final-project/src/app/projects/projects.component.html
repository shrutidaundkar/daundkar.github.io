          The Identity Authentication using Ethereum project is a decentralized
          application (dApp) that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to enable
          secure authentication and verification of user identities.
        </li>
        <li>
          The project is built using the Solidity programming language and the
          Truffle development framework, and it employs the concept of smart
          contracts to ensure that all authentication transactions are
          transparent, tamper-proof, and immutable.
        </li>
        <li>
          The dApp allows users to create an account, which is stored on the
          blockchain, and then use that account to authenticate themselves on
          various websites and applications. The authentication process involves
          the use of public-private key pairs and cryptographic signatures,
          which ensures that only the authorized user can access their account.
        </li>
        <li>
          The project also includes a web interface that enables users to
          interact with the dApp using a user-friendly interface. The interface
          allows users to create and manage their accounts, view their
          transaction history, and access their authentication credentials.
          Overall, the Identity Authentication using Ethereum project showcases
          the potential of blockchain technology in providing secure and
          decentralized solutions for identity management and authentication.

          Fun translations is a mini project I worked on last year to learn
          Angular.Js. The project is a web application that accepts normal
          English messages and translates them into fun languages such as
          Minionese, Yoda, and Pirate. The project's main goal was to learn
          Angular.Js and explore the capabilities of an open-source API for
          language translation.
        </li>
        <li>
          I used Angular.Js to develop the front end of the application,
          implementing a responsive and user-friendly interface that allows
          users to enter their messages and select the fun language they want to
          translate to. An open-source API powered the application's backend for
          language translation, which I integrated into the application using
          Angular.Js.
        </li>
        <li>
          The main reason for building this project was to explore the
          capabilities of Angular.Js and understand how to integrate with an
          external API. The project also allowed me to improve my skills in
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gain experience building responsive and
          user-friendly web applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          The stack I used for this project includes Angular.Js for the front
          end, an open-source API for language translation for the backend, HTML
          and CSS for the layout and styling, and JavaScript for the logic.
